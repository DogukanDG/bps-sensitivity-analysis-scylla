"""
Tests for the Scylla resource-duration plugin.

Scylla gives an activity a single duration regardless of who performs it. Simod
discovers one distribution per resource per activity -- up to 42 on BPIC 2012,
fastest to slowest over a hundredfold apart -- so the converter had been pooling
them into one. The plugin restores the per-resource distributions.

It needed a small core change as well: getDistributionSample() took only a node
id, and the TaskBeginEvent plugin hook fires after the duration is already
sampled. TaskBeginEvent now passes the assigned resources to a new overload,
which falls back to the node-level distribution when no plugin registered any.

Needs a scylla.jar built from a tree containing the plugin; skips without one.
