T4 -- calendars and capacity: locate what actually makes the engines diverge.

T1 shows the two engines agree exactly when nothing is random. On a real model
they do not, and the residual has to be attributed to something before the
comparison study can say anything honest about it.

The method is one controlled variable at a time, all durations fixed so that any
difference is structural rather than sampling noise:

    A  degenerate baseline (T1 conditions)          engines agree
    B  + real resources and their real calendars    engines diverge
    C  real resources, all on a 24/7 calendar       engines agree
    D  one resource, on a real narrow calendar      engines agree
    E  all resources, one shared narrow calendar,   engines agree
       every activity eligible for every resource

C and D isolate capacity and calendars separately; both agree. E adds them
together and still agrees. The only thing left in B that E does not have is
**eligibility** -- which resources may perform which activity -- and that is
exactly what the shared pool gives up.

So the divergence is not calendar semantics, which was the standing hypothesis.
It is that Scylla lets every activity draw on all 47 resources while Prosimos
restricts each to its own subset, as little as 4% of them.

Needs Prosimos and a built scylla.jar; skips cleanly without either.
