"""
Simod/Prosimos duration distributions -> Scylla XML distribution elements.

This is where every translation error is isolated, so it is worth being
explicit about what the numbers mean.

Parameter order was read from the model files themselves
(`BPIC_2012_train.json`, `BPIC_2017_train.json`), not from documentation and
not from SimuBridge, whose `simod_converter.js` reads the wrong indices:

    expon   [mean, min, max]        SimuBridge reads params[1] -> mean 0
    norm    [mean, std, min, max]   SimuBridge treats params[1] as a variance
                                    and square-roots it -> sigma 300 becomes 17
    uniform [min, max]              SimuBridge computes upper = params[1] + lower
    lognorm [mean, var, min, max]
    gamma   [mean, var, min, max]
    fix     [value]

Scylla supports exactly nine distributions
(`SimulationConfigurationParser.java:283-416`); lognormal and gamma are not
among them, and together they are ~60% of the duration distributions in both
BPIC models. Those are approximated by sampling and binning into an
`arbitraryFiniteProbabilityDistribution`, which preserves the tail shape.
Moment-matching to a normal is available but is never the default: these tails
are long and a normal flattens them.
