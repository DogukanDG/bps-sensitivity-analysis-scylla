"""
Scylla output -> the `process_rows` schema the pipeline already speaks.

Scylla's statslogger plugin (`statslogger_nojar`, always on, no configuration)
writes `<global config name>_resourceutilization.xml` next to the other output.
Its process-level `<time>` block carries the aggregates we need, so the XES
event log does not have to be parsed at all:

    <time>
      <flow_time>     min max median Q1 Q3 avg total   -> cycle_time
      <effective>     ...                              -> processing_time
      <waiting>       ...                              -> waiting_time
      <off_timetable> ...                              -> resource-paused time

Mapping to Prosimos:

    cycle_time      = flow_time       same definition
    processing_time = effective       verified against per-activity durations
    waiting_time    = waiting         NOT the same definition, see below

`waiting` is summed per activity instance, not over the case: StatisticsLogger
(:186-195) accumulates every enable -> begin gap, so activities that wait
concurrently are counted more than once. On BPIC 2012 at 3000 cases this makes
the reported waiting total (88.0M s) exceed the flow time total (71.5M s),
which is impossible for a wall-clock measure. Prosimos's waiting_time is
wall-clock per case.

Emitted anyway -- sensitivity analysis compares how a metric responds, not its
level, and this is still monotone in queueing -- but not comparable case for
case. `check_consistency()` flags the worst divergences; lead with cycle_time.

Prosimos's three idle_* metrics fold in time a case sat while its resource was
off-shift. Scylla's nearest equivalent, `off_timetable`, is not defined the same
way, so rather than pass off an approximation the three are emitted as NaN.

There is no `count` field in the XML, so it is recovered as total / avg, which
reproduces the case count exactly (verified against the per-instance list).
