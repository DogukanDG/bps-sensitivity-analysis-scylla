"""
Invoke Scylla on a generated configuration and collect the KPI rows.

One simulation per subprocess. A long-lived JVM driving `SimulationManager`
directly would remove the ~0.5 s startup, but the spike measured a 3000-case
run at 1.58 s wall including that startup -- faster than the Prosimos arm --
so the added complexity is not justified yet. Phase 4 revisits it with a
measurement rather than a guess.

Two Scylla behaviours the caller cannot avoid:

  - `--output` is parsed but never wired to the field `SimulationManager.run()`
    reads, so the flag is silently ignored and output lands next to the global
    config in an auto-named `output_<timestamp>/` directory. Working directories
    are therefore per-run and the produced directory is discovered afterwards.
  - `--enable-bps-logging` is required. Without it Scylla collects no node
    information and writes no KPI file at all.
